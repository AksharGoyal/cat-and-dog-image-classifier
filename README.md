# Cat and Dog Image Classifier
## Used Machine Learning and Neural Networking to create a classifier to classify images as cats and dogs

As part of freeCodeCamp's Machine Learning with Python curriculum, I had to work on the project "Cat And Dog Image Classifier" to create a model that classifies mixed images of cats and dogs as either cats or dogs. I used Image Data Generator to augment the images through flipping horizontally or vertically, zooming, and shifting vertically or horizontally.

This project made me comfortable working with deep learning and images and made me feel more motivated with image-based projects.

Take your time to explore the notebook and enjoy learning 🐈 🐕
